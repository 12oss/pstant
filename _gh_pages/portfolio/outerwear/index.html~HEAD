					<p class="portfolio-description">This was a cross-functional effort to highlight the Squall&reg; outerwear collection for kids. This experience included two videos&#8218; details of outerwear features&#8218; and animated slides. All video concepts were lead by the group creative director with input from the design team. The Squallhouse video was outsourced to an agency and the Squall-has-it-all video was produced in-house. The custom font used was drawn by an in-house illustrator and used for a seamless omni-channel experience throughout the season.</p>
